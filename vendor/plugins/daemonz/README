Daemonz
=======

Automatically starts and stops the daemons in a Rails application.

Install with:
script/plugin install git://github.com/costan/daemonz.git

Please read and modify the automatically generated config/daemonz.yml. The
initial version illustrates the setup needed to start ferret and starling. The
configuration file is ran through Erb, so you can go crazy.

You don't need to do anything in your code for daemonz to work. It will start
the daemons when your server starts, and stop them when your server exits. It
does work with multiple servers.

You can test your daemonz configuration with rake, as shown below. Keep in mind
that the Rake tasks are only provided for testing, and you should not use them
while your Rails application is running. Nothing bad should happen if you run
the tasks by mistake, but things may go astray if you mix the Rake tasks with
application starts and stops.

rake daemons:start # Starts your daemons (for testing only)
rake daemons:stop # Stops your daemons (for testing only)
