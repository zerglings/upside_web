Daemonz
=======

Automatically starts and stops the daemons in a Rails application.

Install with:
script/plugin install git://github.com/costan/daemonz.git

Please read and modify the automatically generated config/daemonz.yml. The initial
version illustrates the setup needed to start ferret and starling. The configuration
file is ran through Erb, so you can go crazy.

You don't need to do anything in your code for daemonz to work. It will start the
daemons when your server starts, and stop them when your server exits. It does
work with multiple servers.
